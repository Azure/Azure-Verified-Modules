Welcome to the Azure Verified Modules (AVM) repo.

Azure Verified Modules (AVM), as "One Microsoft", we want to provide and define the single definition of what a good IaC module is;

- How they should be constructed and built
  - Enforcing consistency and testing where possible
- How they are to be consumed
- What they deliver for consumers in terms of resources deployed and configured
- And where appropriate aligned across IaC languages (e.g. Bicep, Terraform, etc.)

## AVM Mission Statement

Our mission is to deliver a comprehensive Azure Verified Modules library in multiple IaC languages, following the principles of the well-architected framework, serving as the trusted Microsoft source of truth. Supported by Microsoft, AVM will accelerate deployment time for Azure resources and architectural patterns, empowering every person and organization on the planet on their IaC journey.
