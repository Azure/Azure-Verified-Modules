#### ID: SNFR8 - Category: Contribution/Support - Module Owner(s) GitHub

A module **MUST** have an owner that is defined and managed by a GitHub Team in the Azure GitHub organization.

Today this is only Microsoft FTEs, but everyone is welcome to contribute. The module just **MUST** be owned by a Microsoft FTE (today) so we can enforce and provide the long-term support required by this initiative.

{{< hint type=note >}}

The names for the GitHub teams for each approved module are already defined in the respective [Module Indexes](/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/). These teams **MUST** be created (and used) for each module.
