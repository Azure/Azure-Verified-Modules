#### ID: SNFR3 - Category: Testing - AVM Compliance Tests

Modules **MUST** pass all tests that ensure compliance to AVM specifications. These tests **MUST** pass before a module version can be published.

{{< hint type=important >}}

Please note these are still under development at this time and will be published and available soon for module owners.

Module owners **MUST** request a manual GitHub Pull Request review, prior to their first release of version `0.1.0` of their module, from the related GitHub Team: [`@Azure/avm-core-team-technical-bicep`](https://github.com/orgs/Azure/teams/avm-core-team-technical-bicep), OR [`@Azure/avm-core-team-technical-terraform`](https://github.com/orgs/Azure/teams/avm-core-team-technical-terraform).
