This page details the automation that is in place to help with the triage of issues and PRs raised against the AVM modules.

## Schedule based automation

This section details all automation rules that are based on a schedule.

{{< hint type=note >}}
When calculating the number of business days in the issue/triage automation, the built-in logic considers Monday-Friday as business days. The logic doesn't consider any holidays.
{{< /hint >}}

### ITA01TF.1-2

If a bug/feature/request/general question is not responded to after 3 business days, then the AVM Core team will be tagged in a comment on the issue to reach out to the module owner. The AVM core team will also be assigned on the issue.
### ITA01BCP.1-2

If a bug/feature/request/general question that has the label of "Type: AVM 🅰️ ✌️ ⓜ️" is not responded to after 3 business days, then the AVM Core team will be tagged in a comment on the issue to reach out to the module owner. The AVM core team will also be assigned on the issue.

### ITA02BCP.1-2

If after an additional 3 business days there's still no update to the issue that has the label of "Type: AVM 🅰️ ✌️ ⓜ️", the AVM core team will be assigned to the issue and a further comment stating module owner is unresponsive.

### ITA02TF.1-2

If after an additional 3 business days there's still no update to the issue, the AVM core team will be assigned to the issue and a further comment stating module owner is unresponsive.

### ITA04

If an issue/PR has been labelled with "Needs: Author Feedback 👂" and hasn't had a response in 4 days, label with "Status: No Recent Activity 💤" and add a comment.

### ITA05

If an issue/PR has been labelled with "Status: No Recent Activity 💤" and hasn't had any update in 3 days from that point, automatically close it and comment, unless the issue/PR has a "Status: long-term ⏳" - in which case, do not close it.

## Event based automation

This chapter details all automation rules that are based on an event.

### ITA06

When a new issue of any type is created add the "Needs: Triage 🔍" label.

### ITA07

When a new PR of any type is created add the "Needs: Triage 🔍" label.

### ITA08BCP

### ITA09

When #RR is used in an issue, add the label of "Needs: Author Feedback 👂".

### ITA10

When #wontfix is used in an issue, mark it by using the label of "Status: Won't Fix 💔" and close it as not planned.

### ITA11

When a reply from anyone to an issue occurs, remove the "Needs: Author Feedback 👂" label and label with "Needs: Attention 👋".

### ITA12
