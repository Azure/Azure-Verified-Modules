## Value Proposition

Azure Verified Modules (AVM) is an initiative to consolidate and set the standards for what a good Infrastructure-as-Code module looks like.

Modules will then align to these standards, across languages (Bicep, Terraform etc.) and will then be classified as AVMs and available from their respective language specific registries.

AVM is a common code base, a toolkit for our Customers, our Partners, and Microsoft. It's an official, Microsoft driven initiative, with a devolved ownership approach to develop modules, leveraging internal & external communities.

Azure Verified Modules enable and accelerate consistent solution development and delivery of cloud-native or migrated applications and their supporting infrastructure by codifying Microsoft guidance (WAF), with best practice configurations.

<br>

Azure Verified Modules provides two types of modules: Resource and Pattern modules.

AVM modules are used to deploy Azure resources and their extensions, as well as reusable architectural patterns consistently.

Modules are composable building blocks that encapsulate groups of resources dedicated to one task.

- Flexible, generalized, multi-purpose
- Integrates child resources
- Integrates extension resources

AVM improves code quality and provides a unified customer experience.
