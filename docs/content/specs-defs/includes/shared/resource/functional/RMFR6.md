#### ID: RMFR6 - Category: Inputs - Parameter/Variable Naming

Parameters/variables that pertain to the primary resource **MUST NOT** use the resource type in the name.

e.g., use `sku`, vs. `virtualMachineSku`/`virtualmachine_sku`

Another example for where RPs contain some of their name within a property, leave the property unchanged. E.g. Key Vault has a property called `keySize`, it is fine to leave as this and not remove the `key` part from the property/parameter name.
