#### ID: SNFR24 - Category: Testing - Testing Child, Extension & Interface Resources

Module owners **MUST** test that child and extension resources and those [Bicep]({{% siteparam base %}}/specs/bcp/interfaces/) or [Terreform]({{% siteparam base %}}/specs/tf/interfaces/) interface resources that are supported by their modules, are validated in E2E tests as per [SNFR2]({{% siteparam base %}}/spec/SNFR2) to ensure they deploy and are configured correctly.

These **MAY** be tested in a separate E2E test and **DO NOT** have to be tested in each E2E test.
