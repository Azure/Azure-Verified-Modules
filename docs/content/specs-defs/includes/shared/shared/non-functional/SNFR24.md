#### ID: SNFR24 - Category: Testing - Testing Child, Extension & Interface Resources

Module owners **MUST** test that child, extension and [interface resources](/Azure-Verified-Modules/specs/shared/interfaces/), that are supported by their modules, are tested in E2E tests as per [SNFR2](/Azure-Verified-Modules/spec/SNFR2) to ensure they deploy and are configured correctly.

These **MAY** be tested in a separate E2E test and **DO NOT** have to be tested in each E2E test.
