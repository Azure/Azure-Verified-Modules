## ID: SNFR2 - Category: Testing - E2E Testing

Modules **MUST** implement end-to-end (deployment) testing that create actual resources to validate that module deployments work. In Bicep tests are sourced from the directories in `/tests/e2e`. In Terraform, these are in `/examples`.

Each test **MUST** run and complete without user inputs successfully, for automation purposes.

Each test **MUST** also destroy/clean-up its resources and test dependencies following a run.

To see a directory and file structure for a module, see the language specific contribution guide.

### Resources/Dependencies Required for E2E Tests

It is likely that to complete E2E tests, a number of resources will be required as dependencies to enable the tests to pass successfully. Some examples:

- When testing the Diagnostic Settings interface for a Resource Module, you will need an existing Log Analytics Workspace to be able to send the logs to as a destination.
- When testing the Private Endpoints interface for a Resource Module, you will need an existing Virtual Network, Subnet and Private DNS Zone to be able to complete the Private Endpoint deployment and configuration.

Module owners **MUST**:

- Create the required resources that their module depends upon in the test file/directory
  - They **MUST** either use:
    - Simple/native resource declarations/definitions in their respective IaC language, <br> **OR**
    - Another already published AVM Module that **MUST** be pinned to a specific published version.
      - They **MUST NOT** use any local directory path references or local copies of AVM modules in their own modules test directory.

#### Terraform

```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "rsg-test-001"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_log_analytics_workspace" "example" {
  name                = "law-test-001"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  sku                 = "PerGB2018"
  retention_in_days   = 30
}
```

#### Bicep

```bicep
resource logAnalyticsWorkspace 'Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces@2021-12-01-preview' = {
  name: 'law-test-001'
  location: resourceGroup().location
  properties: {
    sku: {
      name: 'PerGB2018'
    }
    retentionInDays: 30
  }
}
```
