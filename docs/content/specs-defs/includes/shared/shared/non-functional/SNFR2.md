#### ID: SNFR2 - Category: Testing - E2E Testing

Modules **MUST** implement end-to-end (deployment) testing that create actual resources to validate that module deployments work. In Bicep tests are sourced from the directories in `/tests/e2e`. In Terraform, these are in `/examples`.

Each test **MUST** run and complete without user inputs successfully, for automation purposes.

Each test **MUST** also destroy/clean-up its resources and test dependencies following a run.

{{% notice style="tip" %}}

To see a directory and file structure for a module, see the language specific contribution guide.

- [Terraform]({{% siteparam base %}}/contributing/terraform#directory-and-file-structure)

##### Required Resources/Dependencies Required for E2E Tests

It is likely that to complete E2E tests, a number of resources will be required as dependencies to enable the tests to pass successfully. Some examples:

- When testing the Diagnostic Settings interface for a Resource Module, you will need an existing Log Analytics Workspace to be able to send the logs to as a destination.
- When testing the Private Endpoints interface for a Resource Module, you will need an existing Virtual Network, Subnet and Private DNS Zone to be able to complete the Private Endpoint deployment and configuration.

Module owners **MUST**:

- Create the required resources that their module depends upon in the test file/directory
  - They **MUST** either use:
    - Simple/native resource declarations/definitions in their respective IaC language, <br> **OR**
    - Another already published AVM Module that **MUST** be pinned to a specific published version.
      - They **MUST NOT** use any local directory path references or local copies of AVM modules in their own modules test directory.

###### Terraform

```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "rsg-test-001"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_log_analytics_workspace" "example" {
  name                = "law-test-001"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  sku                 = "PerGB2018"
  retention_in_days   = 30
}
```

###### Bicep

```bicep
resource logAnalyticsWorkspace 'Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces@2021-12-01-preview' = {
  name: 'law-test-001'
  location: resourceGroup().location
  properties: {
    sku: {
      name: 'PerGB2018'
    }
    retentionInDays: 30
  }
}
```

##### Skipping Deployments (**SHOULD NOT**)

Tests are part of the documentation and ensure thorough testing of the module and parameters. However, there are situation where an actual deployment can't be performed. One could be, that the deployment is too big (the Azure Resource Manager has a [limit of 4MB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/best-practices) for a single deployment) or only one instance of a service can be deployed to a subscription. To still keep a test for reference and documentation, a file named `.e2eignore` can be placed inside a test folder to prevent the test case being deployed by the CI.

{{% tabs title="Details for use in E2E tests" groupid="e2eignore" %}}
  {{% tab title="Bicep" %}}

You **MUST** add a note to the tests metadata description, which explains the excemption.

If you should require the test to be skipped and add a `.e2eignore` file (e.g. \<module\>/tests/e2e/\<testname\>/.e2eignore) in a PR, it requires a member of the AVM Core Technical Bicep Team to approve. The content of the file is listed in the GitHub Action. State the reason for skipping the deployment in the file.

Sample filecontent: ```The test is skipped due to the maximum deployment template of 4MB, which this test exeecds.```

*For resource modules, the 'defaults' and 'waf-aligned' tests can't be skipped.*

The deployment of a test can be skipped by adding a `e2eignore`file into a test folder (e.g. /examples/\<testname\>).
