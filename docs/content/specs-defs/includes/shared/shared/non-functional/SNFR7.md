#### ID: SNFR7 - Category: Testing - Idempotency Tests

Modules **MUST** implement idempotency end-to-end (deployment) testing. E.g. deploying the module twice over the top of itself.

Modules **SHOULD** pass the idempotency test, as we are aware that there are some exceptions where they may fail as a false-positive or legitimate cases where a resource cannot be idempotent.

For example, Virtual Machine Image names must be unique on each resource creation/update.
