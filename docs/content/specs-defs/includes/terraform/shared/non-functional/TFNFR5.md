#### ID: TFNFR5 - Category: Testing - Test Tooling

Module owners **MUST** use the below tooling for unit/linting/static/security analysis tests.
These are also used in the AVM Compliance Tests.

- [Terraform test](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/test)
  - `terraform <validate/fmt/test>`
- [tflint (with azurerm ruleset)](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-azurerm)
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
  - Some tests are provided as part of the AVM Compliance Tests, but you are free to also use Go for your own tests.
