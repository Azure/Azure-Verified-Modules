#### ID: TFNFR34 - Category: Code Style - Using Feature Toggles

A toggle variable **MUST** be used to allow users to avoid the creation of a new `resource` block by default if it is added in a minor or patch version.

E.g., our previous release was `v1.2.1` and next release would be `v1.3.0`, now we'd like to submit a pull request which contains such new `resource`:

```terraform
resource "azurerm_route_table" "this" {
  location            = local.location
  name                = coalesce(var.new_route_table_name, "${var.subnet_name}-rt")
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
}
```

A user who's just upgraded the module's version would be surprised to see a new resource to be created in a newly generated plan file.

A better approach is adding a feature toggle to be turned off by default:

```terraform
variable "create_route_table" {
  type     = bool
  default  = false
  nullable = false
}

resource "azurerm_route_table" "this" {
  count               = var.create_route_table ? 1 : 0
  location            = local.location
  name                = coalesce(var.new_route_table_name, "${var.subnet_name}-rt")
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
}
```
