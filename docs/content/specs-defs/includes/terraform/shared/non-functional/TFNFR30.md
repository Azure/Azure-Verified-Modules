#### ID: TFNFR30 - Category: Code Style - Handling Deprecated Outputs

Sometimes we notice that the name of certain `output` is not appropriate anymore, however, since we have to ensure forward compatibility in the same major version, its name **MUST NOT** be changed directly. It **MUST** be moved to an independent `deprecated_outputs.tf` file, then redefine a new output in `output.tf` and make sure it's compatible everywhere else in the module.

A cleanup **SHOULD** be performed to `deprecated_outputs.tf` and other logics related to compatibility during a major version upgrade.
