## ID: TFNFR31 - Category: Code Style - locals.tf for Locals Only

In `locals.tf`, file we could declare multiple `locals` blocks, but only `locals` blocks are allowed.

You **MAY** declare `locals` blocks next to a `resource` block or `data` block for some advanced scenarios, like making a fake module to execute some light-weight tests aimed at the expressions.
