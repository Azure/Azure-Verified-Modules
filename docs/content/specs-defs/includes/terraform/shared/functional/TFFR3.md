#### ID: TFFR3 - Category: Providers - Permitted Versions

Authors **MUST** only use the following Azure providers, and versions, in their modules:

| provider | min version | max version |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| azapi    | >= 2.0      | < 3.0       |
| azurerm  | >= 4.0      | < 5.0       |

{{< hint type="note" >}}
Authors **MAY** select either Azurerm, Azapi, or both providers in their module.
{{< /hint>}}

Authors **MUST** use the `required_providers` block in their module to enforce the provider versions.

The following is an example.
In it we use the [pessimistic version constraint operator](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/version-constraints#operators) `~>`.
That is to say that `~> 4.0` is equivalent to `>= 4.0, < 5.0`.

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    # Include one or both providers, as needed
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
    azapi = {
      source  = "Azure/azapi"
      version = "~> 2.0"
    }
  }
}
```
