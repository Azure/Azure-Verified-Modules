## ID: BCPNFR11 - Category: Testing - Test Tooling

Module owners **MUST** use the below tooling for unit/linting/static/security analysis tests. These are also used in the AVM Compliance Tests.

- [PSRule for Azure](https://azure.github.io/PSRule.Rules.Azure/)
- [Pester](https://pester.dev/)
  - Some tests are provided as part of the AVM Compliance Tests, but you are free to also use Pester for your own tests.
