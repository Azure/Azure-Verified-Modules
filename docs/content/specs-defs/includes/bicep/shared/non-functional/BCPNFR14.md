#### ID: BCPNFR14 - Category: Composition - Versioning

To meet [SNFR17](/Azure-Verified-Modules/specs/shared/#id-snfr17---category-release---semantic-versioning) and depending on the changes you make, you may need to bump the version in the `version.json` file.

{{< include file="/static/includes/sample.bicep.version.json" language="json" options="linenos=false" >}}

The `version` value is in the form of `MAJOR.MINOR`. The PATCH version will be incremented by the CI automatically when publishing the module to the Public Bicep Registry once the corresponding pull request is merged. Therefore, contributions that would only require an update of the patch version, can keep the `version.json` file intact.

For example, the `version` value should be:

- `0.1` for new modules, so that they can be released as `v0.1.0`.
- `1.0` once the module owner signs off the module is stable enough for itâ€™s first Major release of `v1.0.0`.
- `0.x` for all feature updates between the first release `v0.1.0` and the first Major release of `v1.0.0`.
