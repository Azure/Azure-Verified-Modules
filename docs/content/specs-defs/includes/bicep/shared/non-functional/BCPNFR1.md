## ID: BCPNFR1 - Inputs - User-defined types - General

To simplify the consumption experience for module consumers when interacting with complex data types input parameters, mainly objects and arrays, the Bicep feature of [User-Defined Types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/user-defined-data-types) **MUST** be used and declared.

{{% notice style="tip" %}}

User-Defined Types are GA in Bicep as of version v0.21.1, please ensure you have this version installed as a minimum.

[User-Defined Types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/user-defined-data-types) allow intellisense support in supported IDEs (e.g. Visual Studio Code) for complex input parameters using arrays and objects.

{{% notice style="important" title="CARML Migration Exemption" %}}

While the [transition of CARML]({{% siteparam base %}}/faq/#carml-evolution) modules into AVM is complete, retrofitting [User-Defined Types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/user-defined-data-types) for all modules will take a considerable amount of time.

Therefore, the addition of [User-Defined Types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/user-defined-data-types) is currently **NOT** mandated/enforced. However, past their initial release, all modules **MUST** implement [User-Defined Types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/user-defined-data-types) prior to the release of their next version.
