#### ID: BCPRMNFR2 - User-defined types - AVM-Common-Types

When implementing any of the [shared]({{% siteparam base %}}/specs/shared/interfaces) or [Bicep-specific]({{% siteparam base %}}/specs/bicep/interfaces) AVM interface variants you MUST import their User-defined type (UDT) via the published [AVM-Common-Types](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/tree/main/avm/utl/types/avm-common-types) module.

When doing so, each type MUST be imported separately, right above the parameter or output that uses it.

```bicep
import { roleAssignmentType } from 'br/public:avm/utl/types/avm-common-types:*.*.*'
@description('Optional. Array of role assignments to create.')
param roleAssignments roleAssignmentType[]?
import { diagnosticSettingFullType } from 'br/public:avm/utl/types/avm-common-types:*.*.*'
@description('Optional. The diagnostic settings of the service.')
param diagnosticSettings diagnosticSettingFullType[]?
```

Importing them individually as opposed to one common block has several benefits such as
- Individual versioning of types
- If you must update the version for one type, you're not exposed to unexpected changes to other types

{{% notice style="important" %}}

The `import (...)` block MUST not be added in between a parameter's definition and its metadata. Doing so breaks the metadata's binding to the parameter in question.

{{% /notice %}}

Finally, you should check for version updates regularly to ensure the resource module stays consistent with the specs. If the used AVM-Common-Types runs stale, the CI may eventually fail the module's static tests.
