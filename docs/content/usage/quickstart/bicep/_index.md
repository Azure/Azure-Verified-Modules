## Introduction

This guide shows how to deploy an Azure Verified Module. By leveraging AVM modules, you can rapidly deploy and manage Azure infrastructure without having to write extensive code from scratch.

In this guide, we'll deploy deploy a [Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault/) resource and a Personal Access Token as a secret.

This article is written for a typical "infra-dev" user (cloud infrastructure professional) who is new to Azure Verified Modules and wants learn how to deploy a module the easiest possible way using AVM. The user has a basic understanding of Azure and Bicep templates.

If you first need to learn Bicep, you can find a [Bicep Quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/quickstart-create-bicep-use-modules) on the Microsoft Learn platform, study the [detailed documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/file), or leverage the [Fundamentals of Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/fundamentals-bicep/) learning path.

## Prerequisites

For the best experience, you will need:

- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to develop your solution.
- [Bicep Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep) to author your Bicep template and explore modules published in the [registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/modules#public-module-registry).
- One of the following command line tools:
  - [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) AND [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell)
  - [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to deploy your solution.
- [Bicep CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install#install-manually)
- [Azure Subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/considerations/fundamental-concepts) to deploy your Bicep template.

Make sure you have these tools set up before proceeding.

## Module Discovery

### Find your module

With our scenario in mind, we need to deploy a Key Vault resource and some of its child resources - e.g., a secret. Let's find the AVM module that will help us achieve this.

There are two primary ways for locating published Bicep Azure Verified Modules:

- Option 1 (preferred): Using IntelliSense in the Bicep extension of Visual Studio Code, and
- Option 2: browsing the[AVM Bicep module index](https://aka.ms/avm/moduleindex/bicep).

#### Option 1: Use the Bicep Extension in VS Code

    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

1. In VS Code, create a new file with called `main.bicep`.
1. Start typing `module`, then give your module a symbolic name, such as `myModule`.
1. Use Intellisense to select `br/public`.
1. The list of all AVM modules published in the Bicep Public Registry will show up. Use this to explore the published modules.
  {{< hint type=note >}}The Bicep VSCode extension is reading metadata through [this JSON file](https://live-data.bicep.azure.com/module-index). All modules are added to this file, as part of the publication process. This lists all the modules marked as Published or Orphaned on the [AVM Bicep module index pages](https://aka.ms/AVM/ModuleIndex/Bicep).{{< /hint >}}
1. Select the module you want to use and the version you want to deploy. Note how you can type full or partial module names to filter the list.
1. Right click on the module's path and select `Go to definition` or hit `F12` to see the module's source code. You can toggle between the Bicep and the JSON view.
1. Hover over the module's symbolic name to see the module's documentation URL. Clicking on it leads you to the module's GitHub folder in the [bicep-registry-modules (BRM)](https://aka.ms/BRM) repository, where its source code and documentation are stored as shows [below](#module-details-and-examples).

#### Option 2: Use the AVM Bicep Module Index

    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Searching the Azure Verified Module indexes is the most complete way to discover published as well as planned (proposed) modules. As shown in the video above, use the following steps to locate a specific module on the AVM website:

- Use your web browser to open the AVM website at [https://aka.ms/avm](https://aka.ms/avm).
- Expand the **Module Indexes** menu item and select the **Bicep** sub-menu item.
- Select the menu item for the module type you are searching for: [Resource](/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/bicep/bicep-resource-modules/), [Pattern](/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/bicep/bicep-pattern-modules/), or [Utility](/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/bicep/bicep-utility-modules/).
  {{< hint >}}Since the Key Vault module used as an example in this guide is published as an AVM resource module, it can be found under the [resource modules](/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/bicep/bicep-resource-modules/) section in the AVM Bicep module index.{{< /hint >}}
- A detailed description of each module classifications types can be found under the related section [here](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/specs/shared/module-classifications/).
- Select the **Published modules** link from the table of contents at the top of the page.
- Use the in-page search feature of your browser. In most Windows browsers you can access it using the `CTRL` + `F` keyboard shortcut.
- Enter a **search term** to find the module you are looking for - e.g., Key Vault.
- **Move through the search results until you locate the desired module.**  If you are unable to find a published module, return to the table of contents and expand the **All modules** link to search both published and proposed modules - i.e., modules that are planned, likely in development but not published yet.
- After finding the desired module, click on the **module's name**. The link will lead you to the module's GitHub folder in the [bicep-registry-modules (BRM)](https://aka.ms/BRM) repository, where its [source code](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/tree/main/avm/res/key-vault/vault) its stored along with its [documentation](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/blob/main/avm/res/key-vault/vault/README.md) that also includes [usage examples](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/blob/main/avm/res/key-vault/vault/README.md#Usage-examples).

### Module details and examples

<video width=100% controls muted preload="metadata">

    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

In the module's documentation, you can find detailed information about the module's functionality, components, input parameters, outputs and more. The documentation also provides comprehensive usage examples, covering various scenarios and configurations.

Explore the Key Vault moduleâ€™s documentation for usage examples and to understand its functionality, input parameters, and outputs.

- Note the mandatory and optional parameters in the [**Parameters**](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/blob/main/avm/res/key-vault/vault/README.md#Parameters) section.
- Review [**Usage examples**](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/blob/main/avm/res/key-vault/vault/README.md#Usage-examples). AVM modules are developed including multiple tests. They can be found under the **`tests`** folder and are used as the basis of the usage examples, therefore they are always up-to-date and deployable.

We want to deploy a secret in a new Key Vault instance, without needing to provide other parameters. AVM not only provides these, but it also does it with security and reliability being core principles, as the default settings apply the recommendations of the [Well Architected Framework](/Azure-Verified-Modules/faq/#what-does-avm-mean-by-waf-aligned) where possible and appropriate.

Note how [Example 2](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/tree/main/avm/res/key-vault/vault#example-2-using-only-defaults) seems to do pretty much what we want to achieve.

## Develop your new template using AVM

In this section, you will develop a Bicep template that references the AVM Key Vault module and its child resources and features, such as a secret and role based access control configuration to grant permissions to a user.

1. Start VSCode (make sure the Bicep extension is installed) and open a folder in which you want to work.
2. Create a `main.bicep` and a `dev.bicepparam` file, which will hold parameters for your Key Vault deployment.

The scope for the deployment of the Key Vault instance will be a resource group. The Bicep extension offers code-completion, which makes it easy to find and use the Azure Verified Module. It will e.g. provide the required properties for a module. You can start typing, let the magic do its thing and end up with (we've added comments here, to describe the different names):

<!-- {lineNos=inline} -->
```bicep
module keyVault 'br/public:avm/res/key-vault/vault:0.11.0' = {
  name: // the name of the module's deployment
  params: {
    name: '<keyVaultName>' // the name of the Key Vault instance with constraints like maximum length and the data type
  }
}
```

After setting the values for the required properties, the module can be [deployed](#deploy-your-solution). This minimal configuration automatically applies the security and reliability recommendations of the [Well Architected Framework](/Azure-Verified-Modules/faq/#what-does-avm-mean-by-waf-aligned) where possible and appropriate. These settings can be overridden if needed.

{{< hint type=tip title="Bicep-specific configuration" >}}

We suggest to create a [`bicepconfig.json`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/bicep-config) file, and enable *use-recent-module-versions*, which warns you to use the latest available version of the AVM module.

```json
// This is a Bicep configuration file. It can be used to control how Bicep operates and to customize
// validation settings for the Bicep linter. The linter uses these settings when evaluating your
// Bicep files for best practices. For further information, please refer to the official documentation at:
// https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/bicep-config
{
  "analyzers": {
    "core": {
      "rules": {
        "use-recent-module-versions": {
          "level": "warning",
          "message": "The module version is outdated. Please consider updating to the latest version."
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

{{< /hint >}}

### Define the Key Vault instance

In this scenario, and every other real-world setup, there is a bit more that we want to configure. You can use the documentation URL (by hovering over the module) to see the moduleâ€™s documentation online for other supported parameters. The ```main.bicep``` might look like this:

<!-- {lineNos=inline} -->
```bicep
// the scope, the deployment deploys resources to
targetScope = 'resourceGroup'

// parameters and default values
param keyVaultName string
param resourceLocation string = resourceGroup().location

@description('Disable for development deployments.')
param enablePurgeProtection bool = true

// the resources to deploy
module keyVault 'br/public:avm/res/key-vault/vault:0.11.0' = {
  name: 'key-vault-deployment'
  params: {
    name: keyVaultName
    location: resourceLocation
    enablePurgeProtection: enablePurgeProtection
    // more properties are not needed, as AVM provides default values
  }
}
```

The code I added makes the module usa is for passing in the Key Vault name and optionally change the location and purge protection. You might not want to enable the latter in a non-production environment, as it makes it harder to delete and recreate resources.

The ```dev.bicepparam``` file is optional and sets parameter values for a certain environment. You can instead pass these parameters at the time of deployment (using PowerShell or Azure CLI).

<!-- {lineNos=inline} -->
```bicep
using 'main.bicep'

// environment specific values
param keyVaultName = '<keyVaultName>'
param enablePurgeProtection = false
```

### Create a secret and set permissions

Now let's add a secret to the Key Vault instance and grant permissions to a user to work with the secret. Sample role assignments can be found in [Example 3: Using large parameter set](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/tree/main/avm/res/key-vault/vault#example-3-using-large-parameter-set). See [Parameter: roleAssignments](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/tree/main/avm/res/key-vault/vault#parameter-roleassignments) for a list of pre-defined roles, that you can reference by name instead of a GUID. Again, this is a huge advantage of using AVM, as the code is easy to read and increases the maintainability.

You can also make use of [User-defined data types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/user-defined-data-types) and simplify the parameterization of the modules instead of guessing or looking up parameters. Therefore, first import UDTs from the Key Vault and common types module and leverage the UDTs in your Bicep and parameter files.

For a role assignment, the principal ID is needed, that will be granted a role (specified by its name) on the resource. Your own ID can be found out with `az ad signed-in-user show --query id`.

<!-- {lineNos=inline} -->
```bicep
// the scope, the deployment deploys resources to
targetScope = 'resourceGroup'

// parameters and default values
param keyVaultName string
param resourceLocation string = resourceGroup().location

@description('Enabled by default. Disable for development deployments')
param enablePurgeProtection bool = true

import { secretType } from 'br/public:avm/res/key-vault/vault:0.11.0'
// adding secrets is optional in the Key Vault module
param secrets secretType[]?

import { roleAssignmentType } from 'br/public:avm/utl/types/avm-common-types:0.4.0'
// the role assignments are optional in the Key Vault module
param roleAssignments roleAssignmentType[]?

// the resources to deploy
module keyVault 'br/public:avm/res/key-vault/vault:0.11.0' = {
  name: 'key-vault-deployment'
  params: {
    name: keyVaultName
    location: resourceLocation
    enablePurgeProtection: enablePurgeProtection
    secrets: secrets
    roleAssignments: roleAssignments
  }
}
```

Notice the secrets parameter, which has a UDT ([User-defined data type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/user-defined-data-types)) that is part of the Key Vault module and enables code completion for easy usage. No need to look up what parameters a secret might have. Just start typing and tab-complete what you need from the parameters offered by the Bicep extension in combination with Azure Verified Modules.

And the bicep parameter file now looks like this:

<!-- {lineNos=inline} -->
```bicep
// reference to the Bicep file to set the context
using 'main.bicep'

// environment specific values
param keyVaultName = '<keyVaultName>'
param enablePurgeProtection = false

param secrets = [
  {
    // set required parameters
    name: 'PAT'
    value: '<personalAccessToken>'
  }
]

param roleAssignments = [
  {
    principalId: '<principalId>'
    // using the name of the role instead of looking up the Guid (which can also be used)
    roleDefinitionIdOrName: 'Key Vault Crypto Officer'
  }
]
```

{{< hint >}}
The display names for roleDefinitionIdOrName can be acquired the following two ways:

- From the [parameters section](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/blob/avm/res/key-vault/vault/0.11.0/avm/res/key-vault/vault/README.md#parameter-roleassignments) module's documentation.
- From the `builtInRoleNames` variable in the module's source code. To get there, hit `F12` while the cursor is set on the module path starting with `br/public:`.

### Boost your development with VS Code IntelliSense

Leverage the IntelliSense feature in VS Code to speed up your development process. IntelliSense provides code completion, possible parameter values and structure. It helps you write code more efficiently by providing context-aware suggestions as you type.

Here's how quickly you can deliver the solution we detailed in this section:

    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## Deploy your solution

Now that your template and parameter file is ready, you can deploy your solution to Azure. You can use PowerShell or Azure CLI to deploy your solution.

{{< tabs "deploy" >}}
  {{< tab "PowerShell" >}}

  ```powershell
  # Log in to Azure
  Connect-AzAccount

  # Select your subscription
  Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId '<subscriptionId>'

  # Deploy a resource group
  New-AzResourceGroup -Name 'avm-quickstart-rg' -Location 'germanywestcentral'

  # Parameterize your deployment
  $inputObject = @{
    DeploymentName        = 'avm-quickstart-deployment-{0}' -f (-join (Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMddTHHMMssffffZ')[0..63])
    ResourceGroupName     = 'avm-quickstart-rg'
    TemplateParameterFile = 'dev.bicepparam'
    TemplateFile          = 'main.bicep'
  }

  # Invoke your deployment
  New-AzResourceGroupDeployment @inputObject
  ```

  {{< /tab >}}
  {{< tab "AZ CLI" >}}

  ```bash
  # Log in to Azure
  az login

  # Select your subscription
  az account set --subscription '<subscriptionId>'

  # Deploy a resource group
  az group create --name 'avm-quickstart-rg' --location 'germanywestcentral'

  # Parameterize your deployment
  $inputObject = @(
    '--name',           'avm-quickstart-deployment{0}' -f (-join (Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMddTHHMMssffffZ')[0..63])),
    '--resource-group', 'avm-quickstart-rg',
    '--parameters',     'dev.bicepparam',
    '--template-file',  'main.bicep',
  )

  # Invoke your deployment
  az deployment group create @inputObject
  ```

  {{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Use the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell or the Azure CLI to verify that the Key Vault instance has been successfully created with the correct configuration, along the secret.

## Clean up your environment

When you're ready, tear down the infrastructure. This will remove all the resources created by your configuration:
