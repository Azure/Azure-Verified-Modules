This quickstart section describes the simplest way to get started with the project by providing step-by-step instructions and essential information, allowing you to leverage the benefits of AVM with minimal effort. It guides you through the initial setup, including the necessary tools and configurations, to help you quickly deploy and manage your Azure resources and solutions using Azure Verified Modules (AVM).

## Why should I use Azure Verified Modules?

Using AVM ensures that your infrastructure-as-code deployments adhere to Microsoft's best practices and guidelines, providing a consistent and reliable foundation for your cloud solutions. By leveraging AVM, you can accelerate your development process, reduce the risk of misconfigurations, and enhance the security and compliance of your applications. The AVM Key Vault resource module, used as an example through this chapter, simplifies the deployment and management of Azure Key Vaults, ensuring secure storage and access to your secrets, keys, and certificates.

## Am I "safe" to use the default values?

Using the default values provided by AVM is generally safe as they are configured to follow best practices and ensure a secure and reliable setup. However, it is important to review these values to ensure they meet your specific requirements and compliance needs. Customizing the default values may be necessary to align with your organization's policies and the specific needs of your project.

## Where can I find some examples? How can I find out all the features a given module has to offer?

You can find examples and detailed documentation for the each AVM module in their respective code repository's `README.MD` file that details all the features, input parameters, and outputs. The module's documentation also provides comprehensive usage examples, covering various scenarios and configurations. Additionally, you can explore the module's source code repository. This information will help you understand the full capabilities of the module and how to effectively integrate it into your projects.
