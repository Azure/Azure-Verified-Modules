## Introduction

When developing Azure solutions using Azure Verified Modules (AVM), there are several areas that GitHub Copilot can help you be more productive when working with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for both Bicep and Terraform.:

1. [Creation of your AVM IaC from scratch](#creating-avm-iac-from-scratch)
1. [Copying and adapting existing AVM code snippets and examples](#copying-and-adapting-existing-avm-code-snippets)
1. [Converting non-AVM IaC to use AVM](#converting-non-avm-iac-to-use-avm)
1. [Refactoring Existing AVM IaC to Use Different Technologies or Architectures](#refactoring-existing-avm-iac-to-use-different-technologies-or-architectures)
1. [Updating existing AVM modules to use the latest version](#updating-existing-avm-modules-to-use-the-latest-version)
1. [Creating documentation for your AVM IaC](#creating-documentation-for-your-avm-iac)

Using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) will have a significant benefit in productivity across all three of these areas.

This page will help you use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code to get an AI accelerated benefit when building your scenarios. It will also cover common concepts, approaches and tips that will help you get the most out of GitHub Copilot when working with AVM modules for both Bicep and Terraform.

{{% notice style="Visual Studio Code Recommended" %}}

We currently recommend using Visual Studio Code. This guide focuses on GitHub Copilot & GitHub Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code. Many of the concepts and approaches may be available in other IDEs that support GitHub Copilot, such as JetBrains IDEs and Visual Studio. But at the time of writing this Guide, Visual Studio Code provides the most complete feature set for GitHub Copilot users.

## Setting up your Environment

To get started with using GitHub Copilot for AVM module development, you'll need to have the following prerequisites in place:

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) installed.

  {{% notice style="note" title="GitHub Codespaces" %}}

  You can also use GitHub Codespaces to work on thees repos without needing to install anything locally. For example, open the [https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules) repository in GitHub Codespaces by clicking the button below:
  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure/bicep-registry-modules)

### Adding MCP Servers

Now that you've enabled GitHub Copilot, you can give it access to **tools**, such as searching _Microsoft Learn_ or getting _Azure Bicep Best practices_. Some VS Code extentions automatically provide you access to tools when you install them (for example, the [Github Copilot for Azure](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-github-copilot) extension. But other tools may be provided by [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) servers.

You should enable GitHub Copilot to access the following MCP Servers:

| MCP Server | Description | Install VS Code | Install VS Code Insiders |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Microsoft Docs | Search and retrieve content from Microsoft Learn, Azure documentation, and official Microsoft technical resources. | [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22microsoft-docs%22%2C%22gallery%22%3Atrue%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fapi%2Fmcp%22%7D) | [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](vscode-insiders:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22microsoft-docs%22%2C%22gallery%22%3Atrue%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fapi%2Fmcp%22%7D) |

There are many other MCP Servers that you can configure GitHub Copilot to use, such as [GitHub](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22github%22%2C%22gallery%22%3Atrue%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.githubcopilot.com%2Fmcp%2F%22%7D), but these aren't required to get started with AVM module development. You can find a list of MCP Servers that are curated by the Visual Studio Code team on the [MCP Servers for agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/mcp) page.

For more information on configuring MCP Servers in Visual Studio Code, see the [Model Context Protocol](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) page in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

### Custom Chat Modes

Chat modes in Visual Studio Code let you customize how GitHub Copilot Chat responds for different tasksâ€”like answering questions, editing code, or running automated workflows. You can easily switch between modes in the Chat view to match what you need to do. The default Agent chat mode is great for general tasks, but often makes mistakes or assumptions when it comes to building IaC using AVM modules. For example, it is extremely common for GitHub Copilot to use older or even hallucinated AVM modules.

To prevent these issues we can set up custom chat modes that give GitHub Copilot clear guidance and context for AVM scenarios. This includes providing clear instructions on how GitHub Copilot should retrieve AVM best practices, module documentation and the current versions of each module.

| IaC Type | Title | Description | Install |
| -------- | ----- | ----------- | ------- |
| Bicep | [Azure AVM Bicep mode](chatmodes/azure-verified-modules-bicep.chatmode.md) | Create, update, or review Azure IaC in Bicep using Azure Verified Modules (AVM). | [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode%3Achat-chatmode%2Finstall%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fgithub%2Fawesome-copilot%2Fmain%2Fchatmodes%2Fazure-verified-modules-bicep.chatmode.md) [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode-insiders%3Achat-chatmode%2Finstall%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fgithub%2Fawesome-copilot%2Fmain%2Fchatmodes%2Fazure-verified-modules-bicep.chatmode.md) |
| Terraform | [Azure AVM Terraform mode](chatmodes/azure-verified-modules-terraform.chatmode.md) | Create, update, or review Azure IaC in Terraform using Azure Verified Modules (AVM). | [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode%3Achat-chatmode%2Finstall%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fgithub%2Fawesome-copilot%2Fmain%2Fchatmodes%2Fazure-verified-modules-terraform.chatmode.md) [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode-insiders%3Achat-chatmode%2Finstall%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fgithub%2Fawesome-copilot%2Fmain%2Fchatmodes%2Fazure-verified-modules-terraform.chatmode.md) |

## How to use GitHub Copilot with AVM

GitHub Copilot can significantly enhance your productivity when working with Azure Verified Modules (AVM) for both Bicep and Terraform. It can assist you in various tasks, such as creating new AVM IaC from scratch, copying and adapting existing AVM code snippets, converting non-AVM IaC to use AVM, refactoring existing AVM IaC to use different technologies or architectures, updating existing AVM modules to use the latest version, and creating documentation for your AVM IaC.

### Creating AVM IaC from Scratch

When starting a new AVM module, you can use GitHub Copilot to help generate the initial structure and boilerplate code. For example, you can start typing a comment or a function name, and GitHub Copilot will suggest completions based on the context of your code.

### Copying and Adapting Existing AVM Code Snippets

If you have existing AVM code snippets or examples, you can use GitHub Copilot to help adapt them to your specific needs. For example, you can copy an existing module and start modifying it, and GitHub Copilot will suggest changes based on the context of your modifications.

### Converting Non-AVM IaC to Use AVM

If you have existing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) that does not use AVM, you can use GitHub Copilot to help convert it to use AVM. For example, you can start by copying the existing code and then modify it to use AVM modules, and GitHub Copilot will suggest changes based on the context of your modifications.

### Refactoring Existing AVM IaC to Use Different Technologies or Architectures

If you need to refactor existing AVM IaC to use different technologies or architectures, GitHub Copilot can help. For example, if you're moving to a zero trust architecture, you can start by modifying the existing code and GitHub Copilot will suggest changes based on the context of your modifications.

### Updating Existing AVM Modules to Use the Latest Version

When a new version of an AVM module is released, you can use GitHub Copilot to help update your existing code to use the latest version. For example, you can start by modifying the module version in your code and GitHub Copilot will suggest changes based on the context of your modifications.

### Creating Documentation for Your AVM IaC

GitHub Copilot can also help you create documentation for your AVM IaC. For example, you can start by writing a comment or a function name, and GitHub Copilot will suggest documentation based on the context of your code. This can help you create consistent and comprehensive documentation for your AVM modules.
