## About This Section

This section showcases the AVM team's exploration of cutting-edge technologies and methodologies that have the potential to enhance Azure infrastructure development. The content here represents forward-thinking experiments and proof-of-concepts that we believe are valuable to share with the broader community.

### What to Expect

**Experimental by Nature**: The solutions and approaches documented in this section are under active exploration. They may change significantly, be superseded by better alternatives, or be discontinued as we learn more about their practical applications and limitations.

**Community Innovation**: Some of the tooling, integrations, and methodologies featured here may be developed by community members, partners, or external teams rather than the AVM core team or AVM module owners. While we strive to ensure quality, these solutions may have different support models and maturity levels than core AVM content or AVM modules.

**Shared Learning**: By documenting and sharing these experimental approaches, we aim to foster innovation, gather feedback, and accelerate the discovery of what works well in real-world scenarios. Your experience and feedback with these experimental features are invaluable.

{{% notice style="info" title="Your feedback is welcome!" %}}

We encourage you to try these experimental features and share your experiences. Your feedback helps us understand what resonates with the community and what might be worth developing further or integrating into core AVM guidance.

Provide feedback through [GitHub Issues](https://aka.ms/AVM/QuestionFeedback).

### Use at Your Own Risk

Given the experimental nature of this content, we recommend:

- **Testing thoroughly** in non-production environments before considering production use
- **Understanding the limitations** and potential for breaking changes
- **Having contingency plans** if an experimental feature is deprecated or significantly changed
- **Staying informed** about updates and changes to experimental features you're using
