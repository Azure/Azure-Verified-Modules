### "AVM Core Team Triage" Explained

During the AVM Core Team Triage step, the following will be checked, completed and actioned by the AVM Core Team during their triage calls (which are currently twice per week):

#### Module Proposal triage

An issue is considered to be a module proposal if it was opened through the [module proposal template](https://aka.ms/avm/moduleproposal), and has the labels "Needs: Triage üîç" and "Type: New Module Proposal üí°" applied to them.

1. Add label of "Status: In Triage üîç" to indicate you're in the process of triaging the issue.
2. Check module proposal issue/form:
   - Check the [Bicep](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/bicep/) or [Terraform](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/terraform/) module indexes for the proposed module to make sure it is not already available or being worked on.
   - Make sure the module's details are correct as per specifications - [naming](/Azure-Verified-Modules/specs/shared/#id-rmnfr1---category-naming---module-naming), [classification](/Azure-Verified-Modules/specs/shared/module-classifications/) (resource/pattern) etc.
   - Check if the requestor is a Microsoft FTE
   - If there's any additional clarification needed, contact the requestor through comments (using their GH handle) or internal channels - for Microsoft FTEs only! - (looking them up by their name). Either way, make sure you capture any decisions regarding the module in the comments section.
   - Make adjustments to the module's name/classification as needed.
3. Apply relevant additional labels
    - Module language: "Language: Bicep üí™" or "Language: Terraform üåê"
    - Module classification (resource/pattern): "Class: Resource Module üì¶" or "Class: Pattern Module üì¶"

##### Scenario 1: Requestor doesn't want to / can't be module owner

{{< hint type=note >}}
If requestor is interested in becoming a module owner, but is not a Microsoft FTE, the AVM core team will try to find a Microsoft FTE to be the module owner whom the requester can collaborate with.
{{< /hint >}}

1. If the requester didn't indicate they want to / can't become a module owner, assign the label of "Status: Looking for owners"
2. Move the issue to the "Looking for owners" column on the [AVM - Modules Triage](https://aka.ms/avm/moduletriage) GitHub project board.
2. Find module owners - if not proposed in module proposal OR original person/s proposed to be module owners, do not wan't or cannot be owners of the module:
   - Move the issue into "Looking for owners" column in [AVM - Modules Triage](https://aka.ms/avm/moduletriage) GitHub Project
   - Add the "Needs: Module Owner üì£" label to the issue
   - Try to find owner from AVM communities or await a module owner to comment and propose themselves on the proposal issue
     - When a new owner is potentially identified, continue with the steps described [below](#requestor-wants-to-become-module-owner)

##### Scenario 2: Requestor wants to become module owner

If the requestor indicated they want to become an owner, don't assign the "Status: Owners Identified" label yet as first you need to confirm that they understand the implications of becoming the owner.

1. Clarify module owners roles and responsibilities - if proposed in module proposal:
   - Clarify they understand and accept what "module ownership" means by replying in a comment to the requestor/proposed owner:

{{< expand "‚ûï Standard AVM Core Team Reply to Proposed Module Owners" "expand/collapse" >}}

```text
Hi @{requestor/proposed owner's GitHub alias},

Thanks for requesting/proposing to be an AVM module owner.

We just want to confirm you agree to the below pages that define what module ownership means:

- https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/specs/shared/team-definitions
- https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/specs/shared
- https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/help-support/module-support

Any questions or clarifications needed let us know.

If you agree please just reply to this issue with the exact sentence below (as this helps with our automation üëç):

"I CONFIRM I WISH TO OWN THIS AVM MODULE AND UNDERSTAND THE REQUIREMENTS AND DEFINITION OF A MODULE OWNER"

Thanks

The AVM Core Team
```

{{< /expand >}}

9. Once module owner identified and has confirmed they understand and accept their roles and responsibilities as an AVM module owner
   - Assign the issue to the confirmed module owner
   - Move the issue into "In development" column in [AVM - Modules Triage](https://aka.ms/avm/moduletriage) GitHub Project
   - Add the "Status: Owners Identified ü§ò" label to the issue
     - Remove the "Needs: Module Owner üì£" label from the issue, if applied
10. Update the AVM Module Indexes, following the [process documented internally](https://dev.azure.com/CSUSolEng/Azure%20Verified%20Modules/_wiki/wikis/AVM%20Internal%20Wiki/286/Module-index-file-update-process).
11. Use the following text for approving module development

{{< expand "‚ûï Final Confirmation for Proposed Module Owners" "expand/collapse" >}}

```text
Hi @{requestor/proposed owner's GitHub alias},

Thanks for confirming that you wish to own this AVM module and understand the related requirements and responsibilities.

We just want to confirm and double check a few important things:

- The name of the module will be `<INSERT THE MODULE'S APPROVED NAME HERE>`.
- Please visit the related [module index](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/) page and use the following values explicitly:
  - `ModuleName`
  - `TelemetryIdPrefix`
  - `ModuleOwnersGHTeam` and `ModuleContributorsGHTeam`
  - Repository name and folder path defined in `RepoURL`

You can now start the development of this module! Happy coding! üéâ

Any further questions or clarifications needed, let us know.

Thanks

The AVM Core Team
```

12. Move the issue to the "In development" column on the [AVM - Modules Triage](https://aka.ms/avm/moduletriage) project board.
16. Remove the label of "Status: In Triage üîç" to indicate you're done with triaging the issue.

## Enabling development

12. Update any Azure RBAC permissions for test tenants/subscription, if required
13. Bicep Only:
    - Update `Azure/bicep-registry-modules` [CODEOWNERS file](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS)
14. Once module is developed and `v0.1.0` has been published to the relevant registry, move the issue into "Done" column in [AVM - Modules Triage](https://aka.ms/avm/moduletriage) GitHub Project
15. Update the AVM Module Indexes CSV files with the correct `ModuleStatus`

## Module Owner Has Issue/Is Blocked/Has A Request

In the event that a module owner has an issue or is blocked due to specific AVM missing guidance, test environments, permission requirements, etc. they should follow the below steps:

{{< hint type=tip >}}

Common issues/blockers/asks/request are:

- Subscription level features
- Resource Provider Registration
- Preview Services Enablement
- Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) configuration (SPN creation, etc.)

{{< /hint >}}

1. Create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Verified-Modules/issues/new/choose)
2. Discuss the issue/blocker with the AVM core team
3. Agree upon action/resolution/closure
4. Implement agreed upon action/resolution/closure

{{< hint type=note >}}

Please note for module specific issues, these should be logged in the module's source repository, not the AVM repository.
