This page provides an overview of the contribution process for AVM modules.

## New Module Proposal & Creation

{{% notice style="important" %}}
Each AVM module **MUST** have a [Module Proposal](https://aka.ms/AVM/ModuleProposal) issue created and approved by the AVM core team before it can be created/migrated!

### Provide details for module proposals

When proposing a module, please include the information in the description that is mentioned for the triage process here:

- [Module Proposals]({{% siteparam base %}}/help-support/issue-triage/avm-issue-triage/#module-proposal-triage)
- [Pattern modules]({{% siteparam base %}}/help-support/issue-triage/avm-issue-triage/#triaging-pattern-modules)

## AVM Preview Notice

{{% notice style="important" %}}

As the overall AVM framework is not GA (generally available) yet - the CI framework and test automation is not fully functional and implemented across all supported languages yet - breaking changes are expected, and additional customer feedback is yet to be gathered and incorporated. Hence, modules **MUST NOT** be published at version `1.0.0` or higher at this time.

All module **MUST** be published as a pre-release version (e.g., `0.1.0`, `0.1.1`, `0.2.0`, etc.) until the AVM framework becomes GA.

However, it is important to note that this **DOES NOT** mean that the modules cannot be consumed and utilized. They **CAN** be leveraged in all types of environments (dev, test, prod etc.). Consumers can treat them just like any other IaC module and raise issues or feature requests against them as they learn from the usage of the module. Consumers should also read the release notes for each version, if considering updating to a more recent version of a module to see if there are any considerations or breaking changes etc.

## Module Owner Has Issue/Is Blocked/Has A Request

In the event that a module owner has an issue or is blocked due to specific AVM missing guidance, test environments, permission requirements, etc. they should follow the below steps:

{{% notice style="tip" %}}

Common issues/blockers/asks/request are:

- Subscription level features
- Resource Provider Registration
- Preview Services Enablement
- Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) configuration (SPN creation, etc.)

{{% /notice %}}

1. Create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Verified-Modules/issues/new/choose)
2. Discuss the issue/blocker with the AVM core team
3. Agree upon action/resolution/closure
4. Implement agreed upon action/resolution/closure

{{% notice style="note" %}}

Please note for module specific issues, these should be logged in the module's source repository, not the AVM repository.
