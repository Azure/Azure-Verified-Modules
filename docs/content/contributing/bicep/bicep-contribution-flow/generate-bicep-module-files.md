As per the module design structure ([BCPFR3](/Azure-Verified-Modules/specs/bicep/#id-bcpfr3---category-composition---directory-and-file-structure)), every module in the AVM library requires 
- a up-to-date ReadMe markdown (`readme.md`) file documenting the set of deployable resource types, input and output parameters and a set of relevant template references from the official Azure Resource Reference documentation
- an up-to-date compiled template (`main.json`) file

The `Set-AVMModule` utility aims to simplify contributing to the AVM library, as it supports
- idempotently generating the AVM folder structure for a module (including any child resource)
- generating the module's ReadMe file from scratch or updating it
- compiling/building the module template

To ease maintenance, you can run the utility with a `Recurse` flag from the root of your folder to update all files automatically.

# Location

You can find the script under [`avm/utilities/tools/Set-AVMModule.ps1`](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/blob/main/avm/utilities/tools/Set-AVMModule.ps1)

# How it works

Using the provided template path, the script 
1. validates the module's folder structure
   - To do so, it searches for any required folder path / file missing and adds them. For several files, it will also provide some default content to get you started. The sources files for this action can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/tree/main/avm/utilities/tools/helper/src)
1. compiles its bicep template 
1. updates the readme (recursively, specified)
   1. If the intended readMe file does not yet exist in the expected path, it is generated with a skeleton (with e.g., a generated header name)
   1. The script then goes through all sections defined as `SectionsToRefresh` (by default all) and refreshes the sections' content (for example, for the `Parameters`) based on the values in the ARM/JSON Template. It detects sections by their header and always regenerates the full section.
   1. Once all are refreshed, the current ReadMe file is overwritten. **Note:** The script can be invoked combining the `WhatIf` and `Verbose` switches to just receive an console-output of the updated content.

# How to use it

For details on how to use the function, please refer to the script's local documentation.

{{< hint type=note >}}

The script must be loaded ('*dot-sourced*') before the function can be invoked.
```PowerShell
. 'C:/dev/Set-AVMModule.ps1'
Set-AVMModule (...)
```
