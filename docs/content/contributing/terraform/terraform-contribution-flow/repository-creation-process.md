### 1. Find Issues Ready for Repository Creation

1. When a module owner is ready to start development, they will add the &nbsp;<mark style="background-image:none;white-space: nowrap;background-color:#136A41;color:white;">Status: Ready For Repository Creation üìù</mark>&nbsp; label to the proposal via a comment [issue](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Verified-Modules/issues).
1. To find issues that are ready for repository creation, click this [link](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Verified-Modules/labels/Status%3A%20Ready%20For%20Repository%20Creation%20%3Amemo%3A)
1. Open one of the issues to find the details you need.
    1. Module name: This will be in the format `avm-<type>-<name>`. e.g. `avm-res-network-virtualnetwork`
    1. Module owner GitHub handle: This will be in the content of the issue
    1. Module owner display name: You may need to look this up in the open source portal
    1. Module description: If this does not exist, then create one. The description will automtically be prefixed with `Terraform Azure Verified <module-type> Module for ...`, where `<module-type>` is either Resource, Pattern, or Utility
    1. Resource provider namespace: You may need to look this up if not included in the issue
    1. Resource type: You may need to look this up if not included in the issue
    1. Module alternative names: Consider if it would be useful to search for this module using other names. If so, add them here. This is a comma separated list of names
    1. Module comments: Any comments you want to add to the module index CSV file
    1. Owner secondary GitHub handle: This is optional. If the module owner has a secondary GitHub handle
    1. Owner secondary display name: This is optional. If the module owner has a secondary display name

### 2. Create the repository

1. Open a PowerShell terminal
1. Clone the <https://github.com/Azure/avm-terraform-governance> repository and navigate to the `tf-repo-mgmt/repository_creation_helper` folder

    ```pwsh
    git clone "https://github.com/Azure/avm-terraform-governance"
    cd ./tf-repo-mgmt/repository_creation_helper
    ```

1. Install the GitHub CLI if you don't already have it installed: <https://cli.github.com>
1. Login to GitHub CLI

    ```pwsh
    gh auth login -h "github.com" -w -p "https" -s "delete_repo" -s "workflow" -s "read:user" -s "user:email"
    ```

    Follow the prompts to login to your GitHub account.

1. Run the following command, replacing the values with the details you collected in step 1

    ```pwsh
    # Required Inputs
    $moduleProvider = "azurerm" # Only change this if you know why you need to change it (Allowed values: azurerm, azapi, azure)
    $moduleName = "<module name>" # Replace with the module name (do not include the "terraform-azurerm" prefix)
    $moduleDisplayName = "<module description>" # Replace with a short description of the module
    $resourceProviderNamespace = "<resource provider namespace>" # Replace with the resource provider namespace of the module (NOTE: Leave empty for Pattern or Utility Modules)
    $resourceType = "<resource type>" # Replace with the resource type of the module (NOTE: Leave empty for Pattern or Utility Modules)
    $ownerPrimaryGitHubHandle = "<github user handle>" # Replace with the GitHub handle of the module owner
    $ownerPrimaryDisplayName = "<user display name>" # Replace with the display name of the module owner

    # Optional Metadata Inputs
    $moduleAlternativeNames = "<alternative names>" # Replace with a comma separated list of alternative names for the module
    $ownerSecondaryGitHubHandle = "<github user handle>" # Replace with the GitHub handle of the module owner
    $ownerSecondaryDisplayName = "<user display name>" # Replace with the display name of the module owner

    ./New-Repository.ps1 `
        -moduleProvider $moduleProvider `
        -moduleName $moduleName `
        -moduleDisplayName $moduleDisplayName `
        -resourceProviderNamespace $resourceProviderNamespace `
        -resourceType $resourceType `
        -ownerPrimaryGitHubHandle $ownerPrimaryGitHubHandle `
        -ownerPrimaryDisplayName $ownerPrimaryDisplayName `
        -moduleAlternativeNames $moduleAlternativeNames `
        -ownerSecondaryGitHubHandle $ownerSecondaryGitHubHandle `
        -ownerSecondaryDisplayName $ownerSecondaryDisplayName

    ```

    For example:

    ```pwsh
    # Required Inputs
    $moduleProvider = "azurerm" # Only change this if you know why you need to change it (Allowed values: azurerm, azapi, azure)
    $moduleName = "avm-res-network-virtualnetwork" # Replace with the module name (do not include the "terraform-azurerm" prefix)
    $moduleDisplayName = "Virtual Networks" # Replace with a short description of the module
    $resourceProviderNamespace = "Microsoft.Network" # Replace with the resource provider namespace of the module (NOTE: Leave empty for Pattern or Utility Modules)
    $resourceType = "virtualNetworks" # Replace with the resource type of the module (NOTE: Leave empty for Pattern or Utility Modules)
    $ownerPrimaryGitHubHandle = "jaredfholgate" # Replace with the GitHub handle of the module owner
    $ownerPrimaryDisplayName = "Jared Holgate" # Replace with the display name of the module owner

    # Optional Metadata Inputs
    $moduleAlternativeNames = "VNet" # Replace with a comma separated list of alternative names for the module
    $ownerSecondaryGitHubHandle = "" # Replace with the GitHub handle of the module owner
    $ownerSecondaryDisplayName = "" # Replace with the display name of the module owner

    ./New-Repository.ps1 `
        -moduleProvider $moduleProvider `
        -moduleName $moduleName `
        -moduleDisplayName $moduleDisplayName `
        -resourceProviderNamespace $resourceProviderNamespace `
        -resourceType $resourceType `
        -ownerPrimaryGitHubHandle $ownerPrimaryGitHubHandle `
        -ownerPrimaryDisplayName $ownerPrimaryDisplayName `
        -moduleAlternativeNames $moduleAlternativeNames `
        -ownerSecondaryGitHubHandle $ownerSecondaryGitHubHandle `
        -ownerSecondaryDisplayName $ownerSecondaryDisplayName

    ```

1. Update the issue with the following details:
    1. Title: `[GitHub App] Installation Request - Azure Verified Modules`
    1. Body - replace `<repository url>` with the URL of the repository you created in step 2:

        ```markdown
        > __Note:__ If the app is listed on the [Auto-Approved list](https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/github/apps/approvals/), you do not need to complete this form.

        You complete these steps:

        - [x] Confirm the app is not in the [Auto-Approved list](https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/github/apps/approvals/)

### 4. Notify the Module Owner and Update the Issue Status

1. Add a comment to the issue you found in step 1 to let the module owner know that the repository has been created and is be ready for them to start development.

    ```markdown
    @<module owner> The module repository has now been created. You can find it at <repository url>.

    The final step of repository configuration is still in progress, but you will be able to start developing your code immediately.

    The final step is to create the environment and credentials require to run the end to end tests. If the environment called `test` is not available in 48 hours, please let me know.

    Thanks
    ```

1. Add the &nbsp;<mark style="background-image:none;white-space: nowrap;background-color:#27AB03;color:white;">Status: Repository Created üìÑ</mark>&nbsp; label to the issue
