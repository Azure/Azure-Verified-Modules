## CI Environment Overview

AVM's [CI environment for Bicep modules](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/actions) is integrated into the Public Bicep Registry's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules). It's primary purpose is to enable contributors to validate modules and ultimately publish them into the Public Bicep Registry's Container Registry.
