🎉 Join Our Vibrant Community Calls! 🎉

Get ready to mark your calendars and ignite your enthusiasm because our community calls are here to add a dash of excitement to your quarterly routine! 🗓️

🌍 Embracing Global Connections: Our community calls occur on a quarterly basis, ensuring everyone gets a chance to participate regardless of their time zone. We switch between time zones each quarter, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for all members worldwide! 🌏

📣 Engaging Content, Engaging Conversations: Dive into the first half of our calls, where the AVM team takes the stage to share thrilling updates, insightful content, and inspiring stories. Get ready to be dazzled by the latest happenings and developments in our community! 🌟

💬 Your Voice Matters: We open the floor to attendees, inviting you to bring your burning questions, captivating stories, ingenious suggestions, or simply your cheerful presence. It's a space where every voice is valued and every story is celebrated! 🎤

📹 Can't Make It? No Problem! We understand that life gets busy, but FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) shouldn't hold you back! If you can't join us live, fret not! Every meeting is recorded and later published on our YouTube channel, ensuring you never miss a moment of the action! 📽️

Let's make each community call a vibrant celebration of connection, collaboration, and camaraderie!
