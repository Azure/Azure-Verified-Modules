Hi @avm_module_owner,

Thanks for confirming that you wish to own this AVM module and understand the related requirements and responsibilities!

Check if this module exists in the other IaC language. If so, collaborate with the other owner for consistency. 👍
 You may now create the repository if it hasn't already been created. Please follow the steps [here](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/contributing/terraform/terraform-contribution-flow/repository-creation-process/) to create the repository.

You can now start the development of this module! ✅ Happy coding! 🎉

**Please respond to this comment and request a review from the AVM core team once your module is ready to be published! Please include a link pointing to your PR, once available. 🙏**
