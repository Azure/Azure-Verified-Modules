Hi @{module_owner},

Thanks for confirming that you wish to own this AVM module and understand the related requirements and responsibilities!

We just want to ask you to double check a few important things.

**Please use the following values explicitly as provided in the [module index](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/) page**:

- You must be the owner of the GitHub teams as outlined [here](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/specs/shared/#id-snfr20---category-contributionsupport---github-teams-only).
- Please check that your name has been updated in the module index page (this should happen shortly after you confirmed ownership).

You can now take ownership of this module and start improving it as needed! âœ… Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰

Any further questions or clarifications needed, let us know!

Thanks,

The AVM Core Team
