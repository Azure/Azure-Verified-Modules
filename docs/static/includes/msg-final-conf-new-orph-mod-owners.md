Hi @avm_module_owner,

Thanks for confirming that you wish to own this AVM module and understand the related requirements and responsibilities!

We just want to ask you to double check a few important things.

**Please use the following values explicitly as provided in the [module index](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/) page**:

- You must become the owner (maintainer) of the GitHub team as outlined [here](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/spec/SNFR20). If the previous owner is no longer available, submit an ticket via [aka.ms/opensource/ticket](https://aka.ms/opensource/ticket) to take ownership of the team.
- If applicable, remove the "Orphaned module" information notice from the module's `README.md` file as per [these instructions](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/help-support/issue-triage/avm-issue-triage/#when-a-new-owner-is-identified) page.
- Please check back in a bit to make sure that your name has been updated in the module index page (this should happen shortly after you confirmed ownership).

You're now the owner of this module and can start improving it as needed! âœ… Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰

Any further questions or clarifications needed, let us know!

Thanks,

The AVM Core Team
