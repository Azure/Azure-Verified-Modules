Hi @{module_owner},

Thanks for requesting/proposing to be an AVM module owner!

We just want to confirm **you agree to the below pages** that define what module ownership means:

- [Team Definitions & RACI](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/specs/shared/team-definitions)
- [Shared Specification (Bicep & Terraform)](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/specs/shared)
- [Module Support](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/help-support/module-support)

Any questions or clarifications needed, let us know!

If you agree, please just **reply to this issue with the exact sentence below** (as this helps with our automation üëç):

"I CONFIRM I WISH TO OWN THIS AVM MODULE AND UNDERSTAND THE REQUIREMENTS AND DEFINITION OF A MODULE OWNER"

Thanks,

The AVM Core Team
