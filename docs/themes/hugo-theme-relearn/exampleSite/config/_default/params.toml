# These options set your overall visual appearance.

# Used color variants.

# This sets one or more color variants, available to your readers to choose
# from. You can
# - set a single value eg. 'zen-light'
# - an array like [ 'neon', 'learn' ]
# - an array with options like [ { identifier = 'neon' },{ identifier = 'learn' } ]
# The last form allows to set further options for each variant.
# The `identifier` is mandatory. You can also set `name` which overrides the
# value displayed in the variant selector.
# If the array has more than one entry, a variant selector
# is shown in the lower part of the menu. The first entry in the array is the
# default variant, used for first time visitors.
# The theme ships with the following variants: 'relearn-bright',
# 'relearn-light', 'relearn-dark', 'zen-light', 'zen-dark', 'neon', 'learn',
# 'blue', 'green', 'red'. In addition you can use auto mode variants. See the

# You can also define your own variants. See the docs how this works. Also,
# the docs provide an interactive theme generator to help you with this task.

# running. Also some proxies dislike this optimization.

# Avoid generator meta tags.
# Default: false
# Set this to true if you want to disable generation for generator meta tags
# of Hugo and the theme in your HTML head. In this case also don't forget to
# set Hugo's disableHugoGeneratorInject=true. Otherwise Hugo will generate a
# meta tag into your home page anyways.
disableGeneratorVersion = false

# Avoid unique IDs.
# Default: false

# may not function correctly anymore.

# Additional code dependencies.
# Default: See hugo.toml of the theme

# - `disableTitle`, boolean. If `true`, there is no title above the tree.

#    from the menu `title` according to Hugo's documentation and if not set
#    from the menu `name` and if this is not set form the page's `linkTitle`.
