## 2.8.0 (2021-11-03) {#2-8-0}

### Change

- {{% badge style="note" title=" " %}}Change{{% /badge %}} Although never officially documented, this release removes the font `Novacento`/`Novecento`. If you use it in an overwritten CSS please replace it with `Work Sans`. This change was necessary as Novacento did not provide all Latin special characters and lead to mixed styled character text eg. for Czech.

### New

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} The theme now supports favicons served from `static/images/` named as `favicon` or `logo` in SVG, PNG or ICO format [out of the box](configuration/branding/logo#change-the-favicon). An overridden partial `layouts/partials/favicon.html` may not be necessary anymore in most cases.

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} You can hide the table of contents menu for the whole site by setting the `disableToc` option in your `hugo.toml`. For an example see [the example configuration](configuration/reference).
