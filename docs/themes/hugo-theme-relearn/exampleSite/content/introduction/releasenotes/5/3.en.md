## 5.3.0 (2022-10-07) {#5-3-0}

### Change

- {{% badge style="note" title=" " %}}Change{{% /badge %}} In the effort to comply with WCAG standards, the implementation of the collapsible menu was changed. The functionality of the new implementation does not work with old browsers (Internet Explorer 11).

### New

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} [Image formatting](authoring/markdown#css-classes) has two new classes to align images to the `left` or `right`. Additionally, the already existing `inline` option is now documented.

- {{% badge style="info" icon="plus-circle" title=" " %}}New{{% /badge %}} Printing for the [`swagger` shortcode](shortcodes/openapi) was optimized to expand sections that are usually closed in interactive mode. This requires [print support](configuration/sitemanagement/outputformats#print-support) to be configured.
